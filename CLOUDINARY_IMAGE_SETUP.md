This guide will help you set up image uploads using Cloudinary for your ChatGPT Clone application.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Create Cloudinary Account
1. Go to [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) and create a free account
2. After signing up, you'll be taken to your dashboard
3. Find your account details in the "Account Details" section

### 2. Get Your Credentials
From your Cloudinary dashboard, copy these values:
- **Cloud Name** (e.g., `your-cloud-name`)
- **API Key** (e.g., `123456789012345`)
- **API Secret** (e.g., `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456`)

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Cloudinary Configuration
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name-here
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret-here
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Replace the placeholder values with your actual Cloudinary credentials.

### 4. Test Your Configuration
1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Visit: `http://localhost:3000/api/test-cloudinary`
3. You should see a success message if everything is configured correctly

## ‚úÖ Verification Steps

### Method 1: API Test
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-cloudinary
```

Expected response for successful setup:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "configured": true,
  "message": "Cloudinary is properly configured and connected!",
  "cloudName": "your-cloud-name"
}
```

### Method 2: Upload Test
1. Go to your chat application
2. Select a vision model (like GPT-4 Vision)
3. Click the paperclip icon
4. Upload an image
5. The image should appear in the chat and be processed by the AI

## üéØ Features Enabled

- ‚úÖ **Image Upload to Cloudinary**: All images are stored in the cloud
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Optimization**: Images are automatically compressed and optimized
- ‚úÖ **CDN Delivery**: Fast image loading from Cloudinary's global CDN

## üîß Configuration Options

### Image Upload Settings
The following settings are configured in your environment:

```env
# File Upload Configuration
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=10
ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES=image/jpeg,image/jpg,image/png,image/gif,image/webp
ENABLE_IMAGE_UPLOADS=true
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### Upload Flow
1. **User selects image** ‚Üí Frontend validates file type and size
2. **Image sent to `/api/upload`** ‚Üí Server uploads to Cloudinary
3. **Cloudinary processes** ‚Üí Returns optimized image URL
4. **Image stored in chat** ‚Üí URL saved with message
5. **AI processing** ‚Üí Image sent to vision models for analysis

### Message Format
When you send an image, it's formatted for AI models:

**OpenAI GPT-4 Vision:**
```javascript
{
  role: "user",
  content: [
    { type: "text", text: "Analyze this image" },
    { 
      type: "image_url", 
      image_url: { 
        url: "https://res.cloudinary.com/your-cloud/image/upload/...",
        detail: "high"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Anthropic Claude:**
```javascript
{
  role: "user",
  content: [
    { type: "text", text: "Analyze this image" },
    { 
      type: "image",
      source: {
        type: "base64",
        media_type: "image/jpeg",
        data: "base64-encoded-image-data"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Cloudinary not configured" Error
**Problem**: Environment variables not set correctly
**Solution**: 
- Check `.env.local` file exists in project root
- Verify variable names are exactly as shown above
- Restart your development server after changes

#### 2. "Invalid credentials" Error
**Problem**: Wrong API credentials
**Solution**:
- Double-check your credentials in Cloudinary dashboard
- Ensure no extra spaces in environment variables
- Try regenerating API secret in Cloudinary

#### 3. "Upload failed" Error

#### 4. Images not showing in chat
**Problem**: URL access issues
**Solution**:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify image URLs are accessible
- Check if Cloudinary URLs are being generated correctly

```env
NODE_ENV=development
```

This will show detailed logs for:
- Upload requests
- Cloudinary responses
- Image processing steps
- Error details
